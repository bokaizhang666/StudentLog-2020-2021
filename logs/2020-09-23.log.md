- [ ] Meet with Mx. Collard to go over what I missed
- [ ] Udacity Shell Workshop Sections 11-14 and 17

Signing-on I encountered some technical difficulties with submitting my Chemistry test, which unfortunately caused me to miss Computer Science on Monday. Therefore, I plan to meet with Mx. Collard to go over what I missed and catch up to the rest of the class.

- [X] Meet with Mx. Collard to go over what I missed
- [ ] Udacity Shell Workshop Sections 11-14 and 17

Signing-off I just met with Mx. Collard and we went over the Bash Quest project and caught me back to speed. Mx. Collard also gave me a extension on part 2 of the Udacity Shell Workshop, so I will study for my test and work on Computer Science tomorrow and Friday instead.
