- [ ] Improve image sprites for social media icon
- [X] Fix background for dive page 

Signing-off Class is just over. We went over how to fix the image sprites in class, but I did not have enough time to fix them myself. I will do that before I meet with Mx. Collard. Furthermore, I was able to fix the background for the dive page. my goal is to finish all of the pages before I meet with Mx. Collard this week.
