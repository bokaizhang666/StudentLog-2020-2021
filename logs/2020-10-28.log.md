- [ ] Rewatch second css video
- [ ] Add css styling to my Portfolio
- [ ] Add navigation bar to my Portfolio

Signing-on I am going to rewatch the second css video to better understand how to add classes. I was sick Tuesday and still don't feel quite well, so I stayed in bed most of today. However, I will try to complete Milestone 2 nonetheless. To complete Milestone 2, I will add a navigation bar and finish the css styling for my portfolio.

Signing-off I just finished my Milestone 2. However, while I did add a navigation bar, it does not work as intended. So I will try to fix my navigation bar and make my website better looking with more css for Milestone 3.
