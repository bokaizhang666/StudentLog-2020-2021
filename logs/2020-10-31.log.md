- [ ] Finish Milestone 3 of portfolio project

Signing-on I am going to create a Blogs and a Contact section for my website. Then, I will fix the padding for certain sections on my 
styles.css to improve the aesthetics of my portfolio. Afterwards, I will try to fix the links of my navigation bar so it works. Lastly, I will add comments for both the index.html and styles.css files.
