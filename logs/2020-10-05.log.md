Signing-on I am in class right now. I aim to finish 2 directories complete with ASCII Art by the end of class.

- [ ] Finish 2 directories for Bash Quest

Signing-off Class just finished. I could not add 2 more directories, but I updated all 3 of my current directories with ASCII art and tested them in the terminal. I did not discover any bugs yet so that's definitely a good sign!
