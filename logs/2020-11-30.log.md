- [X] Find template and paste my portfolio information in 
- [ ] Update my Projects section describing my Beach Resort Project

Signing-off Class is over. I was able to find a template and paste my portfolio information in, but I was unable to update my Projects section describing my Beach Resort Project becase the complexity of the template made it difficult for me to paste my portfolio into the template.
