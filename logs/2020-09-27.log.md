Signing-off I am almost done with the Self-Evaluation form, but I have a few clarifying questions that I will need to ask Mx. Collard. Oter than that, my Self-Evaluation is complete. I have also made a Google slide for the desigh document for the Bash Quest project, but that is also not complete yet. I will finish these either tonight or tomorrow.
